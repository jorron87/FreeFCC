/**
 * Re-arms event-driven Auto FCC after a reboot if the user enabled it.
 *
 * The auto-FCC preference is stored in SharedPreferences and survives a reboot,
 * but Android kills all app processes on reboot — so the keepalive foreground
 * service must be re-started explicitly. This receiver does that by reading
 * the auto_fcc flag and starting [FccKeepaliveService] if it's on.
 *
 * RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED is a normal (install-time) permission, so no runtime
 * request is needed.
